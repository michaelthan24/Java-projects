Both of the fractional knapsack and 0/1 knapsack will both ask for input. First it will ask you to enter the capacity of the knapsack. Next it will ask for number of objects. Then it will ask for weights and profits of each object. Enter all the weights first then the profits for each respective weight. I ran these codes in eclipse and the command line. The output for both algorithms will be the list of objects used for the knapsack and also the maximum profits.
