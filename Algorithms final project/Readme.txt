Sudoku Solver:
I ran this program in eclipse. To run this program, you need the input.txt file. That file has all the sudoku values. You can edit the numbers to which ever sudoku puzzle you need to solve. Just make sure you edit the file location in the code to where your input.txt file is in your computer. There will be a comment that will tell you to replace the file path with the path to the file on your computer. The program will read the text file and output the solve sudoku

0/1 Knapsack:
To run this file you will need the inputKnap.txt file. You can also edit with whichever weights and profits you want. Just make sure the file path in the code is to the file path in your computer. Also if you want to use a different list of items, you need to change the number of maxWeight in the code. Once the program is ran, it will out put the visited node, profit, weight, bound, max profit and updated Priority queue at every step. It will also output maximum profit.

Traveling Salesman Problem:
To run this file, once again you need a text file: inputTSP.txt. Make sure the path to this file is replace in the code with the path to the text file in your computer. If you wish you use your own adjacency matrix, please do the previously mentioned step as well. The program will output the optimal tour from node 0 to node...., and the length of the tour will also be outputted.
